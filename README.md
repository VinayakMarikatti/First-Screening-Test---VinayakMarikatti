# First-Screening-Test---VinayakMarikatti
I have uploaded all my sections Screens for web and mobile frames.
Decisions taken
Clear Pricing for Everyone  I designed a simple and clean pricing section that helps users quickly understand what they get whether they’re just starting or scaling up. It shows both free and affordable paid plans clearly with no confusion.
Easy-to-Read Data Insights  I added visual dashboards and charts that help users instantly see key performance metrics like meeting count, task status, and team efficiency making it easier to track progress and take action.
Feature Highlights That Matter  I focused on what users actually care about smart meeting features like MOM reports, cloud storage, and team collaboration. It’s explained in a clean card layout with short, helpful descriptions.
